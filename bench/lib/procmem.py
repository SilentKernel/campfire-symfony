"""Per-process memory of a container, by role, while a cable run goes on (bench/run).

  procmem.py sample CGROUP_DIR OUT.jsonl        # every 250 ms until killed or the cgroup goes

Adapted from once-campfire-rust bench/lib/procmem.py (Copyright (c) 37signals, LLC, MIT): roles
for the Django, Laravel, Express, Elixir, Go and Symfony ports added.

Roles, from each process's command line:
  Rails    `puma` (Puma's master and workers, which also serve Action Cable), `thrust` (Thruster),
           `redis` (cable pub/sub and the Resque queue), `jobs` (resque-pool and its workers)
  Django   `uvicorn` (the supervisor and its workers, spawned by multiprocessing; HTTP, Action
           Cable and the job thread all run in them). Its Redis is a separate container.
  Laravel  `nginx`, `php-fpm` (master and workers), `cable` (php bin/cable, Workerman),
           `jobs` (php artisan queue:work)
  Laravel/Octane  `frankenphp` (Octane's FrankenPHP server and its master), `cable`, `jobs`
  Symfony  `frankenphp` (Caddy + PHP worker threads), `cable` (bin/console campfire:cable),
           `jobs` (bin/console messenger:consume)
  Express  `node` (the cluster primary, which runs the jobs, and its HTTP/WebSocket workers)
  Elixir   `beam` (the BEAM: Bandit, Action Cable, jobs), `thrust`, `redis`, and its native
           helpers (campfire-vips, campfire-html) as `helper`
  Go, Rust `campfire` (one process, its own front server included)
and `other`. Each sample sums, per role, Pss (proportional set size, so pages forked workers share
with their master count once) and RssAnon (anonymous resident memory, counted in every process
that maps it), both from /proc/PID/smaps_rollup, in MB.
